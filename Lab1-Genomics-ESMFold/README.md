# ESMFold, Protein Structure Analysis

Understanding the structure of proteins like antibodies is important for understanding their function. However, it can be difficult and expensive to do this in a laboratory. Recently AI-driven protein folding algorithms have enabled biologists to predict these structures from their aminio acid sequences instead.
